## Sentiment Analysis

<div style="text-align: justify">Building on our previous analyses, which have meticulously dissected various aspects of mental health videos through time-series evaluations and an in-depth exploration of video metadata, we now turn our focus to a crucial and often underexplored facet: how these videos convey. 

This phase of our investigation seeks to bridge the gap between quantitative data and the qualitative essence of the content, through NLP analysis methodologies. By delving into the emotional undercurrents of these videos, we aim to paint a comprehensive picture, discovering out whether the top mental health videos are trying to use some tricks to become more popular - strong tone? engaging keyword? Are they using these to attract audiences?
