# Mental Health: Trendy Problem?
> RQ1: Is mental health a trend on YouTube?

We all know that `Mental Health` is not a new topic today. At the beginning of 21st Century, one in four adults in US suffered from some form of mental illness -â€” nearly 60 million Americans in any given year _(Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2009)_. 

Then it comes to September 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted mental health worldwide. The problem got much worse and went into the public sight again after the outbreak of the pandemic. According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, cases of anxiety and depression have `increased by 25%` globally since the pandemic began, with suicide the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. Approximately `one in five people` in post-conflict settings have a mental health condition.

**But, it is already a trend before the pandemic?** Internet reflects people's life within a certain period. We found many videos about mental health on Youtube even before the pandemic. Therefore, we would like to focus on the them to get the answers. 

## 1.1 How to Get Target Videos?

Before starting the analysis, we need to get videos about mental health first! At the same time, we plan to retrieve videoes of other topics so that comparison can be made between different trends to further validate our hypothesis.

### 1.1.1 First Filter (keywords matching)

The method we use is based on the string matching of keywords. The idea is that:

1) We come up with a list of keywords  that is supposed to connect to the filed of mental health, including: `mental health`, `disorder`, `solitude`, `depress`, `stress`, `suicid`, etc.

2) Since the dataset is extremely large, we read the files line by line and process them in a batch size of 200000. Three attributes are taken into account during processing, namely `description`, `tags` and `title`. If **at least two out of three text fields** contain a word in our designed word list, we assume that video is relevent and be retrieved. 

**Problem**: However, after the first filter and printing partial results, the problem is that many of them seems irrelevant to mental health like _The Lego Batman Movie: Batman's Lonely Life_. As a result, the first version of analysis results are not very satisfactory, and we get little information. To solve the problem, here comes to our second filter. 

![problem](assets/img/fixproblem.png)

### 1.1.2 Second Filter (snow ball sampling)
Here comes the solution. We have done several additional filtering aiming for a more desired outcome.

1) After retrieving, we check the results manually and see if there is any insightful words that occur in the result but is not included in our designed keyword list. If such word exists, we `iteratively add them to the list` and `repeat the process` 1-3 times to update the results until no new words can be found, just like snowball!  

2) We require that in the `title` of the video, at least one of keywords should exist, which is tighter than the `two out of three requirement` above.

3) We eliminate some videos belonging to categories like `Music`, `Movie` since we inspect the content of the videos and most of them are false positive.

4) Specifically for `mental health` videos, we filter some of the undesired contents based on keywords like `monkey`, `malone`, for they show little relevance to the topic.

5) Finally, use a wordcloud figure and display our final results to validate the results we obtained so far.

{% include samples.html %}

![wordcloud](assets/img/wordcloud.png)

It is easy to find out that now after the improvement, our final results are much more relevant and convincing ðŸŽ‰! 

**Further Improvement**: It takes a long time to process through the data, so we cannot do the loop many times. However, further filter on the topic may include improving keyword list quality, adopting stemming on words for better matching, etc.

### 1.1.3 Control Group
Aside from the target videos reagarding mental health, we also aim to retrieve videos of **three representative types**:

- Long-term trendy videos: This type of videos is the result of a long-term social trend, reflecting the raising awareness of some profound topics, e.g. `gender equality`, `climate change`. These topics enjoy a long-lasting attention and a steady increase in terms of YouTube videos. We hypothesize that `mental health` should belongs to such topic.

- Short-term trendy videos: This type of videos represents a very fashionable impulse on people posting same kind of videos just because other people are also doing it. The heat may be extreme at the moment but may not last long. Example such as `ice bucket challenge`, etc.

- Control group videos: This type of videos had not been brought to the spot of light during 2015-2019, but nonetheless we may still observe a growth in the number of videos on YouTube because the user growth and prevelant influence of digitilization.

We would like to compare the trend of the three types of videos and see if any interesting conclusion may be drawn from the results.


## 1.2 Trend or not? 

Now everything is ready! It is time to look at the time trend -- how much videos about mental health are uploaded per month and their growth over the years.

![invitation](assets/img/are-you-ready.gif)

### 1.2.1 Mental Health Videos
Now we focus on the mental health videos uploaded per month from 2006 to 2019. 

We display both video `numbers` and `ratios` throughout the year and applied a `linear regression analysis` to analyze if there is a trend. 

{% include ratio.html %}

Althought we do see **a mild upward trend**, the p-value of the LR analysis indicates the relation is not statistically significant. To this end, **we couldn't demonstrate any significant increase of the uploaded mental health videos.**

However, we do not want to immdediately jump to a conclusion that there's no trend for the uploaded videos at all. What about other socially important topics? What are their performance throughout years? So, we make comparison with their trend as well, which is illustrated below:

### 1.2.2 Compare with Other Topics

First, let's look at the upload **RATIO**. 


Remember our compared topics are : `gender equality` and `climate change`. We only plot their ratio throughout the years and put it into the log scales for a clearer comparison.

 {% include comparison.html %}

It is rather surprising to see that none of the comparing trends shows a dramatic increase for their ratios. Nonetheless, **mental health issues receives more attention than the comparing topics**.

Also, We hypothesize that maybe remaining a stable uploading ratio already means a sustained and consistent attention indicating it is one of the social trend. The upward trend doesn't show because the ranges of videos on YouTube are increasingly explored making the total numbers of videos rises comparably faster than videos from the specific topic.

Ratio of the uploaded video number is not everything, what about the **POPULARITY** of the videos? Here, we define the popularity score as `popularity_score` = `view_count` + `like_count`, and let's compare the ratio of the popularity score of the videos:

{% include popular.html %}

We can see that the ratio of the popularity score of mental health is higher than the other two topics as well. 

Thus, we can conclude that **there is no significant increase in yearly uploading mental health videos**, but compared to other representative topics, **mental health indeed is a hot topic kept being discussed every year** and draw much attention. 

&nbsp;

# Characteristics: What it is talking?
> RQ2: Which topics predominate in the mental health category?

In this section ,we aim to delve deep inside the mental health videos and would like to study two problems:
1) What is the most `frequently mentioned group of people`?  
2) Among all the videos, what is the most `frequently mentioned mental issues`? Disorder or suicide, etc?
3) Finally, throughout the years, do the situation varies?

To do this, we divide the keywords into several groups to our best knowledge, and calculate their frequency according to their appearance in the mental health videos.


## 2.1 Who suffers the most?

We count the frequency of `man`, `woman`, `teenager` and `senior` appeared in our target videos.

{% include people.html %}

And see that throughout all the years: 

As for **age**, mental issues regarding `teenager` remains the biggest problem. It is because adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. (but there could be cofounders like the access to Internet, teenagers therefore get more attention).  

As for **gender**, `woman` is higher than men. There are many factors like biological makeup and experience in society that are thought to increase womenâ€™s vulnerability to mental health disorders.


From a biological standpoint, for example, due to their brainâ€™s wiring, women report higher levels of empathy and emotional understanding than men. These qualities, while generally positive, are closely tied to worsening depression, anxiety, and trauma. Women also have different experiences than men, in general, women are constantly up against societal expectations and pressures that can negatively impact their mental health. For example, women place great importance on their physical appearance â€“ largely because society tells them to do so. 


## 2.2 What is suffered the most? 
Now, let's see the most mentioned category. 

{% include category.html %}

And we can see `stress` is the most mentioned problem, followed by `suicide` and `depress`. They all show a similar trend of increase all these years.



## 2.3 What are the videos talking about?

### 2.3.1 Sentiment of the videos

Let's examine the overall sentiment landscape of mental health videos. What do the sentiment scores, determined by the BERT model, reveal about these conversations? Are they more about delving into the complexities of mental health, or celebrating positive support and outcomes? The prevalence of high sentiment scores suggests that mental health discussions on YouTube are emotionally charged. This raises a question: does this intensity focus more on the complexities of mental health rather than just positive outcomes or support?

{% include distribution_time.html %}

As time progresses, we notice a shift towards negative sentiment. What does this shift signify? Could it indicate a more honest and profound discussion about mental health issues? This evolving sentiment pattern might be a response to a growing demand for authenticity in mental health discussions, rather than a mere adaptation to trends. The consistent increase in negative sentiment over 14 years suggests a deeper, more meaningful change in how mental health is portrayed in digital media.

Now, let's consider how sentiment scores correlate with popularity, defined by `popularity_score` = `view_count` + `like_count`. 

{% include distribution_popularity.html %}

We have two interesting discoveries:

1. At the lower end of the popularity spectrum, there is a notable stability in sentiment, with a subtle decreasing trend overall.
2. As videos become more popular, their sentiment scores become more varied.

* For the first observation, we can perform a linear regression analysis in the middle range. 
    {% include distribution_popularity_regression.html %}

    There is a discernible downward trend in the average sentiment score. This gradual decline could indicate that creators with a larger audience may feel a responsibility to present a more multifaceted and perhaps less idealized view of mental health, aligning with a broader societal trend towards authenticity and acknowledgment of mental health complexities.

* For the second observation, this variability in top videos suggests that more popular videos tend to polarize opinion. This pattern could be driven by a genuine desire to contribute to the destigmatization of mental health issues or a pursuit of popularity or trend-following. To understand what the popular videos are trying to deliver with such polarized sentiment score distributions, we may turn to topic detection analysis based on the LDA model.


### 2.3.2 Topic keywords of the videos

We focus on the top 1000 videos with the highest popularity scores, analyzing their titles to grasp the core topics, as titles can concisely summarize the videos' themes. 


{% include lda_topic.html %}


The analysis uncovers a range of topics. "Psychological," "tips," "love," and "disorders," found in Topics 2 and 6, suggest a serious exploration of mental health issues. These topics likely cover psychological advice, well-being tips, and discussions about mental health disorders, indicating a commitment to mental health education and support.

Conversely, Topics 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 lean towards entertainment or lifestyle content. Words like "funny," "prank," "hacks," "giant," "experiment," and "sneak" imply a focus on engaging viewers with amusing or intriguing activities rather than mental health discussions. This could indicate a trend-following approach among some content creators, aiming to capitalize on popular themes to attract viewership.

Finally, words like "desk," "zen," "garden," and "relieving" in Topic 9 hint at content focused on stress relief and relaxation techniques, relevant to mental health but in a more indirect, lifestyle-oriented manner.

Our findings show that **while there is some content that may follow viewing trends with lighter themes, a significant portion of mental health videos is committed to more profound topics**. The gradual shift towards a more sober tone in descriptions and the emergence of weightier topics in video titles both point towards a digital environment that is **increasingly reflective of the real societal dialogue on mental health**.

# What does the Trend Bring?
In the above part, we talk about the mental health videos on YouTube. 

Now, hold on for a while. The nature of the problem might depend on your perspecitve! Let's look at **how the target videos influence other videos and channels.**

![perspective](assets/img/perspective.jpeg)







## 3.1 New Contents? 
> RQ3: Is there an impact on new content?



&nbsp;

## 3.2 Followers? 
> RQ4: Did old channels followed the trends?

Did old channels that were not speaking about mental health start speaking about it?

THIS IS A PROVA DAJEEEEE

&nbsp;

## 3.3 Performance: What brings to followers?
> RQ5: For those following channels, does the trend have positive / negative impact on them? 

Can we see an increase (or decrease) in performance (subscribers, views, likes, ...) for channels that speak about mental health?
