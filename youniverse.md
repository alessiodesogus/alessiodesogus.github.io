# The Dataset We Used
We are using the dataset [YouNiverse](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.46500463), a large collection of channel and video metadata from English-language YouTube presented by _Dr.Ribeiro_ and _Dr.West_. It comprises metadata for over 136k channels and 72.9M videos published between May 2005 and October 2019, as well as channel-level time-series data of weekly subscriber and view counts.

# Mental Health: is it trendy?
<!-- > RQ1: Is mental health a trend on YouTube? -->

`Mental Health` has never been a new topic: as early as the beginning of 21st Century, one in four adults in US suffered from mental illness -- that is nearly 60 million Americans in any given year _(Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2009)_. However, not many of us paid serious attention to such problem. It all starts to change in September 2021, the year COVID-19 pandemic broke out, when things gets paticularly bad and the word mental health has become a publicly aware problem. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), because of the lockdown and economic setbacks, cases of anxiety and depression have `increased by 25%` globally, with suicide the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. Approximately `one in five people` in post-conflict settings have a mental health condition. 

**Is there a sign already showing the trend of mental health before the pandemic?** YouTube has been serving as a mirror reflecting people's life within a certain period. So we focus on the time from 2006 to 2019 to look for the answers.

<!-- We found many videos about mental health on Youtube even before the pandemic. Therefore, we would like to focus on the them to get the answers.  -->

## 1.1 How do we acquire target videos?

<!-- Before starting the analysis, we need to get videos about mental health first! At the same time, we plan to retrieve videoes of other topics so that comparison can be made between different trends to further validate our hypothesis. -->

Everything starts with data! How can we retrieve the desired mental health videos from millions of YouTube entries?

### 1.1.1 Snow ball sampling based on keywords

The retrievel method is based on the string matching of keywords. The idea is that:

1) We come up with a list of keywords  that is supposed to connect to the filed of mental health, including: `mental health`, `disorder`, `solitude`, `depress`, `stress`, `suicid`, etc. Particularly, we examine the three text columns of the metadata, namely `description`, `tags` and `title` and require **at least two out of three text fields** contain such a word in our designed word list, then we can assume that this video is relevent and be retrieved.

2) However, the initial keywords list may not be comprehensive. So it is necessary for us to look at the results and iteratively add new representative words to complete the list. The process is just like making a snowball! Here, some of the words we added include `sociopath`, `psycho`, etc.

Seems nice! However, after this step we print out the results and find many of retrieved videos seems irrelevant at all, such as _The Lego Batman Movie: Batman's Lonely Life_. It seems that it is only logical to perform a tighter filter and elinate the undesired records.

![problem](assets/img/fixproblem.png)

### 1.1.2 Filter based on video category and eliminate unnecessary keywords
Here comes the solution. We have done several additional filtering aiming for a more desired outcome.

<!-- 1) After retrieving, we check the results manually and see if there is any insightful words that occur in the result but is not included in our designed keyword list. If such word exists, we `iteratively add them to the list` and `repeat the process` 1-3 times to update the results until no new words can be found, just like snowball!   -->

- We addtional require that in the `title` of the video, at least one of keywords should exist, which is tighter than the `two out of three requirement` above.

- We eliminate some videos belonging to categories like `Music`, `Movie` since we inspect the content of the videos and most of them are false positive.

- Specifically for `mental health` videos, we filter some of the undesired contents based on keywords like `monkey`, `malone`, for they show little relevance to the topic.

Now lets see some of our results:

{% include samples.html %}

![wordcloud](assets/img/wordcloud.png)

Great! Our final results are now much more relevant and convincing ðŸŽ‰, and we are ready to step into the next step! 

<!-- **Further Improvement**: It takes a long time to process through the data, so we cannot do the loop many times. However, further filter on the topic may include improving keyword list quality, adopting stemming on words for better matching, etc. -->

<!-- ### 1.1.3 Control Group
Aside from the target videos reagarding mental health, we also aim to retrieve videos of **three representative types**:

- Long-term trendy videos: This type of videos is the result of a long-term social trend, reflecting the raising awareness of some profound topics, e.g. `gender equality`, `climate change`. These topics enjoy a long-lasting attention and a steady increase in terms of YouTube videos. We hypothesize that `mental health` should belongs to such topic.

- Short-term trendy videos: This type of videos represents a very fashionable impulse on people posting same kind of videos just because other people are also doing it. The heat may be extreme at the moment but may not last long. Example such as `ice bucket challenge`, etc.

- Control group videos: This type of videos had not been brought to the spot of light during 2015-2019, but nonetheless we may still observe a growth in the number of videos on YouTube because the user growth and prevelant influence of digitilization.

We would like to compare the trend of the three types of videos and see if any interesting conclusion may be drawn from the results. -->

## 1.2 What does data say?

### 1.2.1 New videos

Numbers matter! -- We closely investigate how many videos about mental health are uploaded per month over the years to examine if there is a trend at all. In the plot, we display both the `absolute numbers` and `ratios with respect to all videos uploaded that month` throughout the year and applied `linear regression` to fit the data.  Hmmm, it seems there is a mild growing trend! But, wait a second, are you sure? -- To examine the validity, we look at p-value of the LR analysis and it is __0.109__, indicateing that the relation is not statistically significant. To this end, **we couldn't conclude any significant increase of the numbers and ratios regarding mental health videos.**

{% include ratio.html %}

However, we do not want to immdediately jump to a conclusion that there's no trend for the uploaded videos at all. What about other socially important topics? What are their performance throughout years? So, we make comparison with their trend as well. Specificaly, we choose `gender equality` and `climate change` as our compared topics, two other important social issues receiving growing attention. We plot their respective ratio throughout the years and put it into the log scales for a clearer comparison. It is rather surprising to see that none of the comparing trends shows a dramatic increase for their ratios. Nonetheless, **mental health issues receives more attention than the comparing topics**.

 {% include comparison.html %}

Maybe... We hypothesize that remaining a stable uploading ratio already means a sustained and consistent attention indicating it is one of the social trend. The upward trend doesn't show because the ranges of videos on YouTube are increasingly explored making the total numbers of videos rises comparably faster than videos from the specific topic.

### 1.2.1 Popular?
Numbers is not everything, what about the **POPULARITY** of the videos? Here, we define the popularity score as `popularity_score` = `view_count` + `like_count`, and let's compare the ratio of the popularity score with respect to the added popularity_score of the videos: Still no trend, but more: We can see that the ratio of the popularity score of mental health is higher than the other two topics as well. 

{% include popular.html %}

Thus, we reach a conclusion that **there is no significant increase in yearly uploading mental health videos**, but compared to other representative topics, **mental health indeed is a hot topic kept being discussed every year** and draw much attention. 

&nbsp;

# Characteristics: What it is talking?
> RQ2: Which topics predominate in the mental health category?

In this section ,we aim to delve deep inside the mental health videos and would like to study two problems:
1) What is the most `frequently mentioned group of people`?  
2) Among all the videos, what is the most `frequently mentioned mental issues`? Disorder or suicide, etc?
3) Finally, throughout the years, do the situation varies?

To do this, we divide the keywords into several groups to our best knowledge, and calculate their frequency according to their appearance in the mental health videos.


## 2.1 Who suffers the most?

We count the frequency of `man`, `woman`, `teenager` and `senior` appeared in our target videos.

{% include people.html %}

And see that throughout all the years: 

As for **age**, mental issues regarding `teenager` remains the biggest problem. It is because adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. (but there could be cofounders like the access to Internet, teenagers therefore get more attention).  

As for **gender**, `woman` is higher than men. There are many factors like biological makeup and experience in society that are thought to increase womenâ€™s vulnerability to mental health disorders.


From a biological standpoint, for example, due to their brainâ€™s wiring, women report higher levels of empathy and emotional understanding than men. These qualities, while generally positive, are closely tied to worsening depression, anxiety, and trauma. Women also have different experiences than men, in general, women are constantly up against societal expectations and pressures that can negatively impact their mental health. For example, women place great importance on their physical appearance â€“ largely because society tells them to do so. 


## 2.2 What is suffered the most? 
Now, let's see the most mentioned category. 

{% include category.html %}

And we can see `stress` is the most mentioned problem, followed by `suicide` and `depress`. They all show a similar trend of increase all these years.



## 2.3 What are the videos talking about?

### 2.3.1 Sentiment of the videos

Let's examine the overall sentiment landscape of mental health videos. 

What do the sentiment scores, determined by the BERT model, reveal about these conversations? Are they more about delving into the complexities of mental health, or celebrating positive support and outcomes? 

{% include distribution_time.html %}

As time progresses, we notice a shift towards negative sentiment. What does this shift signify? Could it indicate a more honest and profound discussion about mental health issues? 

This evolving sentiment pattern might be a response to a growing demand for authenticity in mental health discussions, rather than mere trends. The consistent increase in negative sentiment over 14 years suggests a deeper, more meaningful change in how mental health is portrayed in digital media.

Now, let's consider how sentiment scores correlate with popularity, defined by `popularity_score` = `view_count` + `like_count`. 

{% include distribution_popularity.html %}

We have two interesting discoveries:

1. At the lower end of the popularity spectrum, there is a notable stability in sentiment, with a subtle decreasing trend overall.
2. As videos become more popular, their sentiment scores become more varied.

For the first observation, we can perform a linear regression analysis in the middle range. 

{% include distribution_popularity_regression.html %}

There is a discernible downward trend in the average sentiment score. This gradual decline could indicate that creators with a larger audience may feel a responsibility to present a more multifaceted and perhaps less idealized view of mental health.

For the second observation, this variability in top videos suggests that more popular videos tend to polarize opinion. Maybe, this pattern comes from 
1. genuine desire to contribute to the destigmatization of mental health issue?
2. a pursuit of popularity = trend-following? 

To understand what the popular videos are trying to deliver with such polarized sentiment score distributions, we may turn to topic detection analysis based on the LDA model.


### 2.3.2 Topic keywords of the videos

We focus on the top 1000 videos with the highest popularity scores, analyzing their titles to grasp the core topics, as titles can concisely summarize the videos' themes. 


{% include lda_topic.html %}


The analysis uncovers a range of topics. Let's try to categorize them and analyze them.

| Topic Numbers | Key Words Combined                                        | Combined Analysis                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0, 1          | stories, real, eating, psychopath, psychological, hacks  | Focuses on personal narratives, real-life stories, and psychological insights, offering viewers relatable content that delves into personal experiences and mental phenomena. |
| 2, 4          | mixing, satisfying, bought, store, giant, mesh, meditation| Centers on activities and practices related to well-being, stress relief, and meditation, providing viewers with practical self-care methods.                                |
| 3, 5          | left, live, kids, bags, squish, old, open, puppy          | Appears to blend discussions on mental health with aspects of family life, learning, and aging, reflecting the pervasive nature of mental health across various life domains.|
| 6, 9          | open, school, supplies, sneak, psychology, vs, kids       | Likely involves educational content and psychological experiments, aiming to raise awareness about mental health issues, especially among younger audiences.                 |
| 7, 8          | psychological, super, illness, mental, old, brain         | Indicates a focus on more serious aspects of mental health, including illness, therapy, and psychological theories, addressing mental health issues in a substantive manner. |



Our findings show that **while there is some content that may follow viewing trends with lighter themes, a significant portion of mental health videos is committed to more profound topics**. The gradual shift towards a more sober tone in descriptions and the emergence of weightier topics in video titles both point towards a digital environment that is **increasingly reflective of the real societal dialogue on mental health**.

# What does the Trend Bring?
In the above part, we talk about the mental health videos on YouTube. 

Now, hold on for a while. The nature of the problem might depend on your perspecitve! Let's look at **how the target videos influence other videos and channels.**

![perspective](assets/img/perspective.jpeg)







## 3.1 New Contents? 
> RQ3: Is there an impact on new content?

Until now, we try to identify the possible videos related mental health, how this category behaves with respect to others and which category of people is the most affected by mental health. But can we now take a look at the problem, from the youtuber point of view? How visualizations and subscribers of a channel are affected after uploading a mental health video?
To answer this question, we can now make use of the behaviour of the visualizations and subscribers of each channel over time. Particularly we have available a sampling of these two quantities every week.
With this informations, we can consider all the channel with at least one mental health video uploaded, and identigy the week in which the channel has uploaded this video. By the studying the week gaining in views and subs before and after this video, we can study these two quantities for every channel and search for significant differences.

{% include histogram_delta_views_before_after.html %}

We can the histogram of these two values all over the channels, using a logarithmic y axis. Already at first glimpse, we can understand that the histogram made by the increament (delta) views after the mental health video seems more shifted to the right, with respect to the increament of the week before the mental health video.


&nbsp;

## 3.2 Followers? 
> RQ4: Did old channels followed the trends?

Did old channels that were not speaking about mental health start speaking about it?



&nbsp;

## 3.3 Performance: What brings to followers?
> RQ5: For those following channels, does the trend have positive / negative impact on them? 

Can we see an increase (or decrease) in performance (subscribers, views, likes, ...) for channels that speak about mental health?
